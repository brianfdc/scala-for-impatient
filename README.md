Hi. If you are reading this, you are brave, brave person. These contain my answers to _Scala for the Impatient_, as well as other attempts to play around with Scala code such as [Akka](http://akka.io/).

My environment is of [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) 2.9.2 using [Scala IDE](http://scala-ide.org/) plugin for Eclipse with 0.12.1 [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) installed. If you're using the Scala IDE plugin for eclipse, use the sbteclipse plugin to generate the Eclipse projects you need so that they can be imported into your workspace.
