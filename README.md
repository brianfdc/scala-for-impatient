Hi. If you are reading this, you are brave, brave person. These contain my answers to _Scala for the Impatient_,
as well as other attempts to play around with Scala code.

My environment is of Scala 2.9.2 using Scala IDE/Eclipse with the m2eclipse plugin.
I also have 0.11.3 SBT installed, but the sbteclipse plugin is not available for
my sbt version and scala version.

So for now, I'm using Maven for dependency management.
